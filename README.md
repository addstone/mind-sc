XMind
=====

[XMind](http://www.xmind.net) is an open source project that contributes to
building a cutting-edge brainstorming/mind-mapping facility, focused on both
usability and extendability. It helps people in capturing ideas into visually
self-organized charts and sharing them for collaboration and communication.
Currently supporting mind maps, fishbone diagrams, tree diagrams, org-charts,
logic charts, and even spreadsheets. Often used for knowledge management,
meeting minutes, task management, and GTD.

1.  Download and install [JDK v1.8 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
1.  Download and install [Eclipse SDK v4.6 or higher](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).
1.  Make a clean workspace.
1.  Import all bundles, features and releng projects into the workspace.
1.  Open `org.xmind.cathy.target/cathy.target` with the default *Target Editor*
    and click on 'Set as Target Platform' in the top-right corner of the opened
    editor (you may have to wait for Eclipse to download all necessary
