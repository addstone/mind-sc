 * A command service domain represents a specific range of access to command
 * services, and provides a local command server and a remote command service
 * discoverer for building/registering a command server and searching for remote
 * command servers within this range. For example, a LAN command service domain
 * may provide a command server that binds itself on a local server socket and
 * use Zeroconf's DNS Service Discovery as the implementor of the remote command
 * service discoverer for searching for remote command services within the local
 * area network.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Connections to this domain should be made before the local command server and
 * remote command service discoverer can return accurate results.
